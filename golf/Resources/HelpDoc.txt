GAMEPLAY 
You control Tiki the Kiwi in his search for the release of his kidnapped
friends. Initially, you are armed with just a bow and arrow, but occasionally
when you kill an enemy, they may drop an item which you con retrieve and use
yourself. There ore many different types of item which you must discover
yourself, but they vary from extra weapons to temporary invulnerability pills.
Kiwis cannot fly and you are no exception, however, you get around this by
knocking/shooting creatures off their balloons, which you can then commandeer
and take to the skies!
Surprisingly, Kiwis cannot breathe under water either, so you must be careful if
you go swimming. Your oxygen level is shown on screen, so make sure you don't
drown!
Shooting water from your mouth replenishes oxygen and can be used to pot your
adversaries.
In the earlier levels, you will be shown arrows on the background which indicate
the direction you must go to release the captive Kiwi on that level, but beware,
on certain stages, releasing your friend alerts the Big Guardian Creature of
that level, and you must first find a way of defeating it before progressing to
the next level. 

Because the various lairs of the walrus are so well guarded, we cannot brief
you further. Your techniques will develop as you play the game and each new
level presents new, frantic and more original challenges!

* Note - make sure you do not waste time sightseeing as you have a limited
period to complete each level.

HINTS AND TIPS

  water - then spit by pressing fire if you want to gain oxygen quickly.

  off.
