Exile
~~~~~


On your return from another mission you are made to divert to the
planet Phoebus by Columbus Force High Command with orders to overpower
the psychopathic Triax and eliminate his evil maggot creations before
they are let loose on Earth to wreak havoc on its innocent population.

You arrive alone and weaponless. Your spacesuit is under-equipped;
its jetpack weak and its weapon slots empty after the toils of the last
mission.

Parking your spaceship in geostationary orbit, the wreck of the Pericles
on the planet far below, you are visiting.

The blurred image of an emerald spacesuit appears ... and disappears.
Your Destinator is stolen. Now, as for the Pericles' crew, you are
marooned. Your spaceship, no longer able to take you off this planet,
floats powerless in orbit.

Only if you retrieve your Destinator can you escape from the planet of
the exile.

But you have a mission to do first.

A classic by P.J.M Irvin & J.C. Smith, debuted on the BBC, C64, and
eventually appeared in all its graphical glory on the amiga, ECS and
AGA (a project that took years).

Quite a technical achievement: the gravity (each object having its own
weight), the particles, the AI. Most people, those aware of its
existance, prefer the look and feel of the ECS version.

Its not just a game, its an adventure! Unique in style and gameplay
(I haven't encountered any other game that is looks/plays similar like
this one). Edge Magazine did an article of the game, and gave it a high
rating among the classics.

With exile's 70's sci-fi atmosphere, the tension building sound
effects - a huge cave system to explore, a living world with robots and
lifeforms both vicious and friendly, frogs, imps, annoying birds,
mushrooms that stun you, pass protected doors and transporters - you'll
need more than a week to complete it. Find chatter and fluffy to aid
you on your mission! It can be hard and frustrating, but its extremely
addictive; a game where you have to use your brain. The game has been
designed such that there are many ways to solve and resolve each of the
various problems and puzzles. Exile deserves more recognition, and it
would be interesting to see this game being transformed into a 3D game!
